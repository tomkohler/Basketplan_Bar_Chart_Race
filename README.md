# Basketplan_Player_Data

This project scrapes data from FIBA Livestats as well as Basketplan.ch and compiles this in a website for the different leagues
producing different statistics not available elsewhere

The UX part is written in HTML/PHP and runs on every apache website
the backend scripts that use heavily OpenCV OCR from Python 
* draw the bar chart race animations - drawing2.py
* draw the radar chart with the performance stats - radarchart2.py
* extract clips from the youtube livestreams (using OpenCV) - clipextract.py

None of the code is genuinely new, it's essentially a compilation of code snipplets provided by different other programmes
and adapted to the world of basketball data extraction and display
